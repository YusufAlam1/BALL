The Play by Play (PbP) data can be found on basketball-reference.com

Here's the pattern of the URLs where you can find the PbP data for each NBA game:

Take this url for example - Game 7 of the 2025 finals OKC vs Pacers:
[https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202506220OKC.html](https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/202506220OKC.html)

The format goes like this:
https://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/pbp/ **YYYYMMDD0XXX** .html

Start with Year - YYYY
Then Month      - MM
Then Day        - DD

Then a 0 (the 0 is mandatory and I believe its to differentiate between NBA (0) and WNBA (1) games)
Then the home team abbreviation Three letters - XXX

Most are intuitive, (CHI = Bulls, BOS = Celtics, etc)
I found it weird though that the Hornets use CHO, its usually CHA

There are datasets online for PbP, a lot are paid, so this document is useful case if we need to scrape.
