    "# What is Linear Regression?\n",
    "- Statistical technique used to find the relationship b/w variables\n",
    "- In ML, linear regression finds relationship b/w features and a label\n",
    "\n",
    "`y = b + w_1x_1`\n",
    "y = predicted label (output)\n",
    "b = bias (y-intercept)\n",
    "w_1 = weight of feature (slope)\n",
    "x_1 = feature (input)\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias and weight are calculated from training\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loss\n",
    "- Loss is a numeric metric describing how wrong a model's predictions are\n",
    "- L_1 Loss -> Sum of absolute values of the difference between the predicted values and actual values\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error -> Average of L_1 losses across a set of N examples\n",
    "- L_2 Loss -> Sum of the squared difference between the predicted values and the actual values\n",
    "- Mean Squared Error -> Average of L_2 losses across a set of N examples\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error -> Square root of the mean squared error\n",
    "\n",
    "- The MSE moves the model more towards the outliers, while MAE doesn't\n",
    "\n",
    "# Gradient Descent\n",
    "- Mathemetical technique which iteratively finds weights and bias which produce the model with lowest loss\n",
    "- The model begins training with randomized weights and biases near zero, and repeats these steps\n",
    "1. Calculate loss w/ current weight + bias\n",
    "2. Determine direction to move the weights and bias to reduce loss\n",
    "3. Move the weight and bias valeus a small amount in the direction that reduces loss\n",
    "4. Return to step one and repeat the process until the model can't reduce the loss any further\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hyperparameters\n",
    "- Hyperparameters are variables which control different aspects of training; the three common being\n",
    "1. Learning rate\n",
    "2. Batch size\n",
    "3. Epochs\n",
    "- In contrast, parameters are like variables, like the weights and bias which are apart of the model itself, and hyperparameters are values that you can control\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Rate\n",
    "- Floating point number you set to influence how quickly the model converges\n",
    "- If the learning rate is too low, the model can take a long time to converge\n",
    "- If the learning rate is too high, the model never converges, but instead bounces around the weights and bias which minimize loss\n",
    "- Determines the magnitude of the changes to make to the weights and bias during each step of the gradient descent process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch Size\n",
    "- Hyperparameter which refers to number of examples in the model processes before updating its weights and bias\n",
    "- Two common techniques to get the right gradient on average without needing to look at every example before updating the weights and bias are stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch stochastic gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Epochs\n",
    "- During training, an epoch means that the model has processed every example in the training set once. \n",
    "- Training typically takes multiple epochs"
