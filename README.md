# BALL Research Project

This repo contains our work for the BALL sports analytics project (injury prediction + related analysis).

#### ðŸ”§ Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\Activate
# mac
source .venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Open the project in VS Code with the following extensions (recommended):


Python -> run notebooks and scripts
Jupyter -> work with .ipynb notebooks directly in VS Code
SQLite Viewer or SQLite Explorer -> browse/query .db files without leaving VS Code

#### ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
nba_prediction/
Main working folder. Contains notebooks, scripts, and results for NBA injury prediction and related experiments.

kaggle/
Raw data and starter notebooks pulled from Kaggle datasets.

strain_of_success/
Soccer injury dataset + exploration (supporting analysis, not main focus).

scrape/
Scripts for scraping or collecting supplemental data.


#### âœ… Notes
Do your analysis work inside the nba_prediction/ folder unless we explicitly decide otherwise.
If you install a new library, add it to requirements.txt so everyone can stay in sync.
Use Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) for exploratory work
